I am a final year undergraduate in [BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/), pursuing a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. My interests lie in these fields:

- Theoretical Computer Science
- Systems and Computer Architecture
- Data Science/Machine Learning

I am currently pursuing an internship at [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com/), where I work in the Flow team(networking and network security). I have also worked on many Machine Learning projects, including attending a bootcamp conducted by Amazon, called the Amazon ML Summer School, which taught ML fundamentals.

In my free time, I enjoy playing online chess, as well as being interested in fantasy and sci fi novels. I am an ardent problem solver, and would love to work on any engaging projects that involve both mathematics and computer science.
