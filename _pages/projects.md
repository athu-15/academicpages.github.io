* Switching Activation Functions
  * Done under Dr. Snehanshu Saha, Professor at BITS Goa.
  * The project involved empirically checking if using two different activation functions would be better than using only one, as well as mathematically proving the same.
  * Did empirical testing on different datasets, as well as 5 Computer Vision datasets, which gave better results when two different activation functions were used. Also mathematically proved that variance was propogated better for sigmoid-tanh neural networks as opposed to sigmoid-sigmoid neural networks.
* Spirit Level Reaction Time Tester
  * Done as a part of the Microprocessors and Interfacing course.
  * Used Assembly language and Proteus with the 8086 processor, to design a reaction time tester. Also used other components like the 8255 interface and the 8253 timer.
* Trinity
  * Done as a part of the Compilers Construction course.
  * Was part of a team that attempted to build a language that could be used for simple 2D game design, particularly to design Tetris.
* <a href="https://github.com/athu-15/Skip-Connections-in-MLPs">Studying Skip Connections in MLPS</a> 
  * Done as a part of the Deep Learning course at BITS Goa.
  * Tested the effects of Skip Connections on MLPs, using the standard datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.
* Language Detection using LSTMs
  * Built a bidirectional LSTM that was used to classify between three languages using audio clips that were between 1 and 4 seconds in length. 
  * Classified 3 languages with around 85% accuracy, using the librosa library to preprocess audio clips and extract MFCCs.
* A Digital System to Check Object Quality
  * Designed a digital system using Logisim to check if a particular object with 4 colours matches a used inputted object with the same 4 colours.
